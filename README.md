# Snake-Game-Using-Turtle
The Python Snake Game is an engaging and interactive project that utilizes the Turtle module and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. In this classic arcade-style game, the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, attempting to eat food while avoiding collisions with itself and the boundaries of the game window.
